        <h2>What is this?</h2>


        <h3> TLDR </h3>
        <p>
        It's a table of the top ~3.5k series in MangaUpdates, and the series
        with which they share their audience the most. The data is based on the
        public list of MangaUpdates users that added these series to their
        <code>read</code>/<code>complete</code>/<code>hold</code> lists.
        A high \(P(A|B)\) means a larger intersection between series \(A\)
        and \(B\) <em>relative to series \(B\)'s size</em>. More concretely:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
        \(P(A|B)\) is the fraction of the readers of \(B\) that have also read \(A\).
        </blockquote>


        <h3>Details</h3>

        <h4>What does P(A|B) actually mean?</h4>
        <p>
        Each row represents a single series, which is the title under the column
        \(A\). The \(B\)'s are chosen by finding out the series that maximizes
        \(P(A|B)\). In other words, the \(B\)'s are the series that have the
        largest intersection with \(A\) in proportion to \(B\).
        </p>
        <p>
        It's easier to show in symbols:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Let \(A\) and \(B\) be series from the top ~3.5k series in MangaUpdates,
            and \(S_A, S_B\) be the set of MangaUpdates users that added \(A\)
            and \(B\) (respectively) to either their <code>read</code>,
            <code>complete</code>, or <code>hold</code> lists. Then we define

                \[ P(A|B) := \frac{\left|S_A \cap S_B\right|}{\left|S_B\right|}. \]

            We just borrowed the notation from probability. To stretch the analogy
            to probability a bit, you can think of this value as "the probability
            that you'll <em>enjoy</em> \(A\) given that you've enjoyed \(B\)."
            This is assuming that the users that add series to their
            <code>read</code>, <code>complete</code>, or <code>hold</code> lists
            tend to enjoy them.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        For each series \(A\), we're trying to get the \(B\) that would maximize
        this value \(P(A|B)\). \(B_1, B_2, ...\) are those series. I.e., the series
        that shares a lot of its readers with \(A\). If you like \(B\), then
        you probably like \(A\)!.
        </p>

        <h4>What's the difference between P(A|B) and P(B|A)?</h4>


        <h4>Why not maximize P(B|A) instead?</h4>

        <p>
        In the table above we're just showing the top 4 \(B\) series that maximize
        \(P(A|B)\). But wouldn't a more natural way to proceed be to get the
        series \(B\) that would maximize \(P(B|A)\), i.e. the series that \(A\)
        readers read the most? This was what I first tried, but fairly quickly
        I found that it just spits out popular series, with almost no relation
        to what \(A\) actually is. Most of them are either
        Naruto/One Piece/Bleach/Shingeki no Kyojin/etc. To give a sense of this,
        I checked the number of unique \(B1\)'s when \(P(A|B)\) vs \(P(B|A)\) is
        being maximized (this shows the relative diversity of recommendations
        of each approach). \(P(A|B)\) gives <code>1284</code> unique \(B1\)'s, while
        \(P(B|A)\) gives a mere <code>311</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
        In other words, for a given \(A\), maximizing \(P(A|B)\)
        is likely to yield \(B\)'s with comparatively small readerships, while
        maximizing \(P(B|A)\) yields \(B\)'s with larger readerships.
        This makes sense, if you look at the definitions of the two:

            \[ P(A|B) := \frac{\left|S_A \cap S_B\right|}{\left|S_B\right|}. \]
            \[ P(B|A) := \frac{\left|S_A \cap S_B\right|}{\left|S_A\right|}. \]

        Maximizing \(P(A|B)\) generally ends up with low \(|S_B|\)'s
        because it's on the denominator (so popular series are penalized).
        As for \(P(B|A)\), \(B\) is present only on the numerator, so it can
        make \(S_A\) as big as it wants without penalty.
        </p>


        <h2>Where/how did you get the data?</h2>

        <p>
        I was originally trying to make an (unnoficial) API for MangaUpdates,
        and just used that to scrape the (publicly-available) data. If you want
        to try it out, here's a link: .
